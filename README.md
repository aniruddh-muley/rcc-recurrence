# rcc-recurrence

Presentation: [RCC Recurrence Prediction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DmLmKmQNzqLNOZdI-sxlNvaq81jLnAhU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115563981610636075357&rtpof=true&sd=true)
A rather unorganized set of notebooks. The aim was to predict recurrence of RCC in patients already afflicted with cancer.
Unfortunately, none of the models used were able to generalize to the data, often giving very poor performance. It may have to do with how I approached modelling/tuning, maybe the data wasn't that great (the data had multiple categorical columns, and very few continuous columns). Still, my first exposure to a real-world project.
